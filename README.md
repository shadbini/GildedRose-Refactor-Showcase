You should make sure the gradle commands shown above work when you execute them in a terminal before trying to use TextTest (see below).

To **build the project**, use:
###

./gradlew build
### Note

This repo contains only the Java solution and its unit tests.  
The `texttests` folder and approval tests mentioned in the original repo were not included.  
Unit tests can be run via:

To **run unit tests**, use:

###
./gradlew test


## Run the TextTest approval test that comes with this project

There are instructions in the [TextTest Readme](../texttests/README.md) for setting up TextTest. What's unusual for the Java version is there are two executables listed in [config.gr](../texttests/config.gr) for Java. The first uses Gradle wrapped in a python script. Uncomment these lines to use it:

    executable:${TEXTTEST_HOME}/Java/texttest_rig.py
    interpreter:python

The other relies on your CLASSPATH being set correctly in [environment.gr](../texttests/environment.gr). Uncomment these lines to use it instead:

    executable:com.gildedrose.TexttestFixture
    interpreter:java
